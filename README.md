**Parkour System in Unity**
A dynamic parkour system for Unity, allowing the player to vault over obstacles with randomized animations. The system detects obstacles and selects a suitable parkour action based on height and other factors.

Features
✅ Randomized parkour actions for obstacles
✅ Uses ScriptableObject for easy animation configuration
✅ Smooth animations with MatchTarget for better alignment
✅ Supports different obstacle heights

**How It Works**
🔹Environment Detection: The EnvironmentChecker detects obstacles in front of the player.
🔹Valid Parkour Actions: The system checks if the obstacle height matches any available NewParkourAction.
🔹Random Action Selection: If multiple actions are valid, one is picked at random.
🔹Animation Execution: The selected action is played, smoothly aligning the player with the obstacle.

**Setup Instructions**
🔹Attach ParkourController to your player object.
🔹Assign an EnvironmentChecker component to detect obstacles.
🔹Create parkour actions via Assets → Create → Parkour Menu → New Parkour Action.
🔹Set animations, heights, and other properties in the created ScriptableObject.
🔹Press Jump to trigger parkour over obstacles!



**Code Snippet**
This snippet ensures a random animation is chosen from the available ones:

void Update()
{
    if (Input.GetButton("Jump") && !playerInAction)
    {
        var hitData = environmentChecker.CheckObstacle();
        if (hitData.hitFound)
        {
            List<NewParkourAction> validActions = new List<NewParkourAction>();

            foreach (var action in newParkourAction)
            {
                if (action.CheckIfAvailable(hitData, transform))
                {
                    validActions.Add(action);
                }
            }

            if (validActions.Count > 0)
            {
                NewParkourAction chosenAction = validActions[Random.Range(0, validActions.Count)];
                StartCoroutine(PerformParkourAction(chosenAction));
            }
        }
    }
}

**Future Improvements**
🔹 Wall-run and climb mechanics
🔹 More fluid blending between animations
🔹 Additional parkour actions (ledge grab, rolling, etc.)
